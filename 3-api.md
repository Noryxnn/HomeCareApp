The primary data storage solution of this application depends on Room. Room creates an abstraction framework which functions as a safe database interface that requires less manual code. The database incorporates Bill GroceryItem and MaintenanceTask entities which have matching Data Access Objects (DAOs) responsible for CRUD operations. Room achieves reactive UI updates through its integration with LiveData implementation. The application utilizes the ViewModel and LiveData components from Android to execute MVVM architecture. Every feature contains a ViewModel that bundles business logics with LiveData components for user interface communication. The approach delivers automatic lifecycle management because it stops memory leak faults during configuration transitions. The application employs Jetpack Navigation component to supervise fragment operations and direct user navigation. The application navigates among its main features through tab selection that relies on BottomNavigationView integration. The Navigation component offers a solution for simplified deep linking between parts of the application while maintaining stable back stack navigation. The application utilizes WorkManager as a background scheduler that manages duties regarding bill and maintenance item due date checking. Through the custom DueDateCheckWorker system processes database data to initiate alerts for upcoming due dates. Android Notifications API enables user alerts through the application via due bill and task notifications. The NotificationHelper class manages both notification channel setup and notification showing procedures. Android versions 13 and higher require runtime permission handling and the system supports previous Android editions through backward compatibility.
