I based my project on the MVVM architecture pattern, ensuring a clear separation between business logic, data, and UI components. For data storage, I used the Room Persistence Library due to its type safety and seamless integration with LiveData. Reliable notification scheduling posed challenges, especially due to Android’s background execution limits. I used a hybrid approach combining WorkManager and Handler-based scheduling, which provided a good balance between reliability and battery efficiency. To store Date objects in Room, I implemented a custom TypeConverter, although future projects would likely use modern date/time APIs. Compatibility required handling Android 13’s notification permission model with version-specific code.

Despite time constraints, not all planned features were implemented: editing and deleting maintenance bills and grocery tasks, supporting both one-time and recurring monthly reminders, and attaching photos (e.g., leaks or receipts). These were deprioritized to focus on app stability and core task functionality. MVVM made the project easier to organize, maintain, and allowed for incremental development—making it easier to pinpoint issues early on. Although some features are missing, the project demonstrates the potential of modern Android architecture components and represents a strong learning experience from the module.
